/**
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *  `syncProfileMirror` — a remembered uid is a fact ONLY under its generation
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The reader caches the organizing install's published document so its settings panes can show
 * what is actually in force. The whole care in this module is the `(uidvalidity, uid)` pair:
 * a folder deleted and recreated numbers from one again, so a uid that survived a renumber points
 * confidently at the wrong message.
 *
 * ── THE DOUBLE IS THE READ RESULT, NOT THE IMAP CLIENT, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE ─────────────
 *
 * `readOrganizerProfile` takes the generation from inside the same lock as the fetch, so a `found`
 * arm's generation and ref are consistent BY CONSTRUCTION and a mixed-epoch set is refused
 * `unreadable` before it ever becomes `found`. Driving this function with a stubbed `ProfileIo`
 * would test that guarantee a second time rather than test THIS module; what this module has to get
 * right is what it does with each of the four answers. So the double supplies the answers.
 *
 * A double must fail the way production fails. The three non-`found` answers here are the real
 * union members, spelled as the engine spells them, and the read-throws case throws — because
 * `state: "unreadable"` and a thrown `ProfileUnavailableError` are DIFFERENT productions and this
 * module treats them the same way for different reasons.

 *
 * WHAT THIS KEEPS, and it is a shipped fix rather than a preference. "the profile module outlives
 * the role now, and a reader was still paying for it" (2026-09-02) removed a reader's fetch of the
 * whole profile source out of the customer's `ohmail/_meta` every 30 s for the life of the
 * attachment, and created `FakeMetaFolder.profileReads` because the ABSENCE of a call was the
 * claim. Mail 0094 gives a reader a REASON to read the document — it renders the organizer's
 * settings instead of its own dead rows — and the reader arm calls this once per 60 s poll, so
 * without a cadence that cost comes straight back at twice the interval and no TTL at all.
 *
 * The bound is {@link DEFAULT_PROFILE_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MS}: a reader's view is at most five minutes
 * behind, and a reader cannot act on what it shows.
 *
 * DRIVEN THROUGH `syncProfileMirror` AND A COUNTING `ProfileIo`, not through `applyProfileRead`:
 * the whole question is whether the READ HAPPENS, so a fixture that hands over an already-read
 * answer cannot ask it. The double counts appends and expunges too — a mirror read that published
 * or deleted anything would be a far worse defect than the one being bounded.
